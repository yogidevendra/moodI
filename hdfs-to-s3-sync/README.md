### Description
The HDFS S3 Sync Application Template continuously ingests files as blocks and backup hadoop HDFS data to Amazon S3 for data upload from hadoop to Amazon.
- The application scales linearly with number of block readers.
- The application is fault tolerant and can withstand node and cluster outages without data loss.
- The application is also highly performant and can perform as fast as the network bandwidth allows.
- The only configuration user needs to provide is source HDFS path and destination S3 bucket name, path and credentials.
- This enterprise grade application template will dramatically reduce your time to market and cost of operations.
