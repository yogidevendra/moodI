### Description
The Kafka process kafka application ingests data from kafka, process them and write back to kafka. This application uses PoJoEvent as an example schema, this can be customized to use custom schema based on specific needs.

- The application is fault tolerant and can withstand node and cluster outages without data loss.
- The application is also highly performant and can process as fast as the network allows.
- It is extremely easy to add custom logic to get your business value without worrying about operational details.
- The only configuration user needs to provide is source and destination kafka broker lists.
- This enterprise grade application template will dramatically reduce your time to market and cost of operations.
