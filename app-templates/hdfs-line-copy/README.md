### Description
The HDFS to HDFS line copy Application Template continuously ingests files as lines from one Hadoop cluster to other retaining one-to-one file traceability.
- The application scales linearly with number of record readers.
- The application is fault tolerant and can withstand node and cluster outages without data loss.
- The application is also highly performant and can perform as fast as the network allows.
- It is extremely easy to add custom logic to get your business value without worrying about connectivity and operational details of HDFS reader or writer.
- The only configuration user needs to provide is source and destination HDFS paths.
- This enterprise grade application template will dramatically reduce your time to market and cost of operations.

Import the application from DataTorrent AppHub and launch it to ingest data from one Hadoop cluster to another.  Follow the tutorial videos or walkthrough document below to launch the template and add custom logic to process the data during ingestion.
