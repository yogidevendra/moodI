## Description

This application demonstrates continuous big data archival from HDFS.
It ingests files as blocks for backup on remote HDFS cluster.

- Applications avoids overhead of re-constructing the original file. Thus, it can process blocks in parallel.
The application keeps the same data at destination but creates part files instead of complete file.
- The application scales linearly with number of block readers.
- The application is fault tolerant and can withstand for node and cluster outages without data loss.
- The application is also highly performant and can perform equivalent to network speed.
- The only configuration user needs to provide is source and destination HDFS paths.
- This enterprise grade application template will dramatically reduce your time to market and cost of operations.
