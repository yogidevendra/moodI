## Description

The Kinesis to Amazon S3 application template demonstrates continuous big data sync from a source to destination while reading data messages from a configured Kinesis stream. This could be easily utilized and extended by any developer to create a fast,  fault tolerant and scalable Big Data Sync or Retention Application to serve business with continuous data.

It ingests records separated by delimiter '|' from configured AWS Kinesis streams and writes each message as a record in Amazon S3 bucket. This application uses PoJoEvent as an example schema, which can be customized to use custom schema based on business requirements.

- The application scales linearly with number of Kinesis shards.
- The application is fault tolerant and can withstand node and cluster outages without data loss.
- The application is also highly performance and can perform as fast as the network bandwidth allows.
- The only configuration user needs to provide is source Kinesis credentials, topic name and destination S3 bucket name, path and credentials.
- This enterprise grade application template will dramatically reduce your time to market and cost of operations.

Import the application from DataTorrent AppFactory and launch it to ingest records separated by '|' from configured AWS Kinesis Stream and writes each message as a record in Amazon S3. Please follow the walkthrough document below to understand the configurable properties. Moreover, one could easily add customized business logic to further process the data during sync.
